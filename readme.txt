Portfolio Assignment
This assignment is for a fullstack course, and consists of a main site and 6 landing pages. The main site was built using HTML, CSS, the landing pages were developed the same but with a little Bootstrap, and a little Sass.

Main Site
The main site serves as the portfolio, and includes an overview of my experience, skills, and interests. It also features links to the landing pages, as well as a contact form.

Landing Pages
Each of the 6 landing pages is dedicated to a specific project or topic related to the author's interests. They include:

Project 1: A landing page for a vacation website.
Project 2: A landing page for a coffee shop
Project 3: A landing page for a giftshop
Project 4: A landing page using bootstrap for style and layout
Project 5: A landing page like the one before but using SASS for style and layout.
Project 6: A landing page for a pub that offers a free chaser and is not a scam.

Technologies Used
The site was built using the following technologies:
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap (for some layout and styling)
Sass (for some additional styling)

In the second half of this portfolio I have added 6 new projects that incorporate javascript.

Project 7: A game I built using HTML Canvas and physics, you need to click the bubbles to pop them, the smaller they are, the more points you get. I also utilized sprite sheets which was a great challenge.
Project 8: Rock Paper Scissors, a classic game against a randomized robot
Project 9: Credit Card Validation form, using regex and a lot of event listeners.
Project 10: Rubik's timer, a timer with a scramble generator, and editable entries
project 11: Pokedex, as the name implies, it's a pokedex, using pokeAPI to render an image and the name of the pokemons
project 12: SWAPI Visualization, visualized the characters in Star wars API (SWAPI), and a neat loading bar.


The site was designed and developed by Gal Rothschild.
